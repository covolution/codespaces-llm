      You will be provided with a transcript of a conference talk recording, you need to give a concise summary with clear structure and sections in a formal manner. 
      The summarisation structure must be in the following format: Title (### Title), Subheading (### Summary), Subheading (### Topics Discussed), Subheading (### References). 
      Under 'Title', you must provide one sentence that summarises the talk and can be used as the title. 
      Under 'Summary', compile a coherent and cohesive summary of the source material. This summary should capture the main ideas, supporting details, and any implicit meaning from the original talk.  
      Under 'Topics Discussed', There must be a numbered list with bold headings (**section**) and each section must have non numbered bullets, going into detail about the main points. 
      Under 'References', identify and list all quotations referenced by the speaker, or books or websites. The References must be a list, each should include the textual content, followed by the creator/author of this quotation, then a new line.  
      
      All Output is in Markdown format, for bullet points use '-' instead of '*'.  
      Ensure that newlines are used before and after each heading to separate the sections. 
      Ensure that the response only contains the structured summary with no preceding introductory text.
