      You will be provided with a transcript of a conference talk recording. Your task is to create a concise, well-structured summary in a formal manner.

      # Instructions

      ## Structure Requirements
      The summary must follow this exact format with four main sections:

      1. **Title** (### heading)
      2. **Summary** (### heading)
      3. **Topics Discussed** (### heading)
      4. **References** (### heading)

      ## Section Guidelines

      ### Title
      - Provide a single, concise sentence that captures the essence of the talk
      - This should be clear enough to serve as the talk's title
      - Keep it under 15 words

      ### Summary
      - Compile a coherent and cohesive overview of the source material
      - Capture the main ideas, key arguments, and supporting details
      - Include any implicit meaning or underlying themes from the talk
      - Aim for 3-5 paragraphs maximum
      - Focus on clarity and conciseness

      ### Topics Discussed
      - Create a numbered list of main topics covered
      - Each topic should have:
        - A **bold heading** describing the topic
        - Multiple bullet points (using '-') with detailed key points
        - Specific examples or insights mentioned by the speaker
      - Include 3-7 main topics
      - Order topics chronologically or by importance

      ### References
      - List all quotations, books, websites, articles, research papers, or other materials referenced by the speaker
      - Group references by type using subheadings (**Books**, **Articles & Papers**, **Quotations**, **Web Resources**)
      - Use a simplified academic citation style for clarity and consistency
      - Only include categories that have references (omit empty categories)
      - Use the following standardized format for each reference type:

      **Books:**
      - Author Last Name, First Initial(s). (Year). *Book Title*. Publisher.
      - Example: Kahneman, D. (2011). *Thinking, Fast and Slow*. Farrar, Straus and Giroux.

      **Articles & Papers:**
      - Author Last Name, First Initial(s). (Year). "Article/Paper Title." *Journal/Conference Name*.
      - For multiple authors, use "et al." after the first author for 3+ authors
      - Example: Vaswani, A., et al. (2017). "Attention Is All You Need." *NeurIPS*.

      **Quotations:**
      - "Quote text" — Author Name, Source/Context (Year if known)
      - Example: "The only way to do great work is to love what you do." — Steve Jobs, Stanford Commencement (2005)

      **Web Resources:**
      - Author/Organization. (Year). "Page/Article Title." Website Name. URL (if mentioned)
      - Example: JetBrains. (2025). "The State of Developer Ecosystem 2025." jetbrains.com/research

      **Tools/Frameworks/Concepts:**
      - Name/Concept — Creator/Author (Context if relevant)
      - Example: SOLID Principles — Robert C. Martin
